# README for TensorFlow Binary Classifier

## Introduction

This Python script demonstrates a simple binary classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is built to predict binary outputs based on the input data provided.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can then install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

## Script Overview

The script is divided into several parts:

1. **Import Libraries**: TensorFlow and NumPy are imported.
2. **Data Preparation**: Arrays for training and target data are defined.
3. **Model Building**: A neural network model with one hidden layer is constructed using Keras.
4. **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
5. **Training**: The model is trained on the provided dataset for 100 epochs.
6. **Testing**: New data is tested using the trained model to make predictions.
7. **Output**: The script outputs the input data, the model's prediction, and a binary representation of the prediction.

## Running the Script

To run the script, simply execute it in your Python environment:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Expected Output

The script will print the test inputs, their corresponding predictions, and binary classifications.
